### Hi there, Lelo here üëã

I'm a recent humanities graduate from the University of Cape Town, passionate about bridging the gap between creativity and technology. I have recently chosen to change careers and am currently studying front-end software development at [CodeSpace Academy](https://www.codespace.co.za/). I am loving the learning experience and am eager to make great strides in the world of tech! 

üíª Aspiring to make a mark in the tech industry, I bring a unique perspective shaped by my humanities background. I believe in the power of storytelling and human-centric design, aiming to blend creativity with code to craft meaningful digital experiences.

üöÄ Join me on this exhilarating adventure as I code my way through the ever-evolving tech landscape. Let's connect, collaborate, and build something extraordinary!
